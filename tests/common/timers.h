/* routine to return time in seconds

   Use:     (void) timers ( &cpu0, &et0 );
           ...code to be timed...
            (void) timers ( &cpu1, &et1 );
           print*,'cpu time for code was ', cpu1-cpu0
           print*,'elapsed time for code was ',et1-et0

NOTE:  AS USED IN THE ASCI BENCHMARKS THIS ROUTINE MUST RETURN
BOTH CPU TIME AND ELAPSED (WALLCLOCK) TIME.  VENDOR MUST SUPPLY
SYSTEM_SPECIFIC CODE TO DO THIS.  THE ROUTINE BELOW IS A SAMPLE
ONLY; ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE ALLOWED.
